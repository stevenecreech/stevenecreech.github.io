	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>The goal of this section of my website is to be a place where I forget about the formality of mathematics, and I attempt to explain some of the math that I do and am interested in such a way that anyone can understand the big ideas.</p>

	    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
