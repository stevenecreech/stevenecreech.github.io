$$\textbf{Abstract:}$$ The goal of this blog post is to discuss and derive a formula for the number of $$k$$-almost primes less than a given value $$x$$. We shall do this for both in the general and square-free case, and we will relate the square-free case to Merten's conjecture.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Given a positive integer $$n>1$$, we have that $$n$$ has a prime factorization given by 

$$
n=\prod_{i=1}^rp_i^{a_i}
$$

We recall that the function $$\Omega(n):=\sum_{i=1}^r a_i$$ counts the number of prime factors of $$n$$ (with multiplicity). We define a $$k$$-almost prime to be a number $$n$$ such that $$\Omega(n)=k$$. We note that a $$1$$-almost prime is just a prime number while a $$2$$-almost prime is known as a semiprime. We remark that Conway also referred to these as primes, biprimes, triprimes, quadprimes, and so on. Now we wish to have a generalization of the prime counting function, $$\pi(x)=\#\{n\leq x: n \text{ is prime}\}$$, so we define the $$k$$-almost prime counting function to be 

$$
\pi_k(x)=\#\{n\leq x:\Omega(n)=k\}.
$$

Thus, we have that $$\pi_k(x)$$ just counts the number of $$k$$-almost primes less than $$x$$. We will also define the related square-free $$k$$-almost prime counting function as

$$
\pi_k^*(x)=\#\{n\leq x:\Omega(n)=k, n\text{ is square-free}\}.
$$

We remark the subtle difference between $$\pi_k$$ and $$\pi_k^*$$ by observing that $$\pi_2(6)=2$$ while $$\pi_2^*(6)=1$$. Since we have that $$4,6$$ are the two semiprimes less than or equal to $$6$$, but $$6$$ is the only square-free semiprime less than $$6$$ as we don't count $$4$$. Thus, another way of viewing $$\pi_k^*(x)$$ is to count the number of positive integers $$n$$ less than $$x$$ with prime factorization $$n=\prod_{i=1}^kp_i$$ where $$p_i\neq p_j$$ for $$i\neq j$$. 

Now the goal will be to give a recursive formula for $$\pi_k(x)$$ and $$\pi_k^*(x)$$. We shall first state the formula for semiprimes as the following theorems. We note that the formula for $$\pi_2(x)$$ was given by R.G. Wilson in 2006 and E. Noel and G. Panos in 2005 <a href = "https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Semiprime.html">(see this note)</a>; however, neither result was published and was only given in a correspondence. Furthermore, I was unable to find a proof of the formula written down anywhere, so we will provide one here. 

$$\textbf{Theorem 1:}$$Let us denote $$p_k$$ to be the $$k$$-th prime number, then we have the following formula for the number of semiprimes and square-free semiprimes less than a given value $$x$$:

$$
\pi_2(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\pi(\sqrt{x})}\left(\pi\left(\frac{x}{p_k}\right)-k+1\right)
$$

$$
\pi_2^*(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\pi(\sqrt{x})}\left(\pi\left(\frac{x}{p_k}\right)-k\right)
$$

We shall then prove the more general form of these statements for $$k$$-almost primes

$$\textbf{Theorem 2:}$$ With the same notation as above, we have the following formulas for the $$k$$-almost primes and square-free $$k$$-almost primes less than a given value $$x$$:

$$
\begin{equation}
\pi_k(x)=
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\pi_k^*(x)
$$

After proving these formulas, we shall relate

<h1>The Semiprime Case</h1>

Now we shall give a proof of $$\textbf{Theorem 1}$$ for the formula for semiprimes primarily because it will highlight the general approach to the $$k$$-almost prime case. In addition,
