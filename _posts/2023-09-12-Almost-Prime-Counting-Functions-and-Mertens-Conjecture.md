$$\textbf{Abstract:}$$ The goal of this blog post is to discuss and derive a formula for the number of $$k$$-almost primes less than a given value $$x$$. We shall do this for both in the general and square-free case, and we will relate the square-free case to Merten's conjecture.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

Given a positive integer $$n>1$$, we have that $$n$$ has a prime factorization given by 

$$
n=\prod_{i=1}^rp_i^{a_i}
$$

We recall that the function $$\Omega(n):=\sum_{i=1}^r a_i$$ counts the number of prime factors of $$n$$ (with multiplicity). We define a $$k$$-almost prime to be a number $$n$$ such that $$\Omega(n)=k$$. We note that a $$1$$-almost prime is just a prime number while a $$2$$-almost prime is known as a semiprime. We remark that Conway also referred to these as primes, biprimes, triprimes, quadprimes, and so on. Now we wish to have a generalization of the prime counting function, $$\pi(x)=\#\{n\leq x: n \text{ is prime}\}$$, so we define the $$k$$-almost prime counting function to be 

$$
\pi_k(x)=\#\{n\leq x:\Omega(n)=k\}.
$$

Thus, we have that $$\pi_k(x)$$ just counts the number of $$k$$-almost primes less than $$x$$. We will also define the related square-free $$k$$-almost prime counting function as

$$
\pi_k^*(x)=\#\{n\leq x:\Omega(n)=k, n\text{ is square-free}\}.
$$

We remark the subtle difference between $$\pi_k$$ and $$\pi_k^*$$ by observing that $$\pi_2(6)=2$$ while $$\pi_2^*(6)1$$. Since we have that $$4,6$$ are the two semiprimes less than or equal to $$6$$, but $$6$$ is the only square-free semiprime less than $$6$$ as we don't count $$4$$.
