	<p> Hi, my name is Steven Creech, I am a graduate student at Brown University under the
		advisement of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/people/jeffrey-hoffstein">Jeff Hoffstein</a>
		and <a href="https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/junehyuk/about?authuser=0">Junehyuk Jung</a>.
		 My primary area of interest lies in number theory. Specifically, I am interested in
		 automorphic forms and hyperbolic geometry. I am currently thinking about quantum unique ergodicity
		for modular forms on cocompact Riemann surfaces arising from quaternion algebras. 

		I graduated in 2020 from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics
		under the advisement of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/">Matt Baker</a>.
