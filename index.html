                This animal is a Sugar Glider. It is part of the marsupial family. This photo was taken at a kangaroo farm in Kelowna, Canada during the Inclusive Paths in Explicit Number Theory Summer School in 2023.

            Hi, my name is Steven Creech, I am a graduate student at Brown University, and am currently on the academic job market.
            I am grateful to be advised by
            <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/people/jeffrey-hoffstein">Jeff Hoffstein</a> and 
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/junehyuk/about?authuser=0">Junehyuk Jung</a>.
            My primary area of interest lies in analytic number theory, although I dabble a bit in computer 
            formalization of mathematics. Specifically, I am interested in automorphic forms 
            and hyperbolic geometry. I am currently thinking about quantum unique ergodicity for modular forms on 
            cocompact Riemann surfaces arising from quaternion algebras.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I graduated in 2020 from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics under the advisement of 
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/">Matt Baker</a>.
