                This animal is a Sugar Glider. It is part of the marsupial family. This photo was taken at a kangaroo farm in Kelowna, Canada during the Inclusive Paths in Explicit Number Theory Summer School in 2023.

        Hi, my name is Steven Creech, I am a graduate student at Brown University under the advisement of 
        <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/people/jeffrey-hoffstein">Jeff Hoffstein</a> and 
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/junehyuk/about?authuser=0">Junehyuk Jung</a>.
        My primary area of interest lies in number theory. Specifically, I am interested in automorphic forms and hyperbolic geometry. I am currently thinking about quantum unique ergodicity for modular forms on cocompact Riemann surfaces arising from quaternion algebras.
