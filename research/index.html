	<p>Abstract: We let f be a half-integral weight modular form of weight κ > 4 on Γ₀(4) that is an eigenfunction 
		of all Hecke operators Tₙ, so that $T_nf = \Lambda_f(n)n^{\frac{\kappa-1}{2}}f$. Let ‖f‖ denote the Petersson 
		norm of f. We study a weighted second moment of the central value of the L-function associated to f over an 
		orthogonal basis $H_\kappa(4)$ of $S_\kappa(\Gamma_0(4))$. This corresponds to studying the following sum:
		$$\sum_{f \in H_\kappa(4)} \frac{\Lambda_f(n) |L(1/2, f)|^2}{\|f\|^2}$$
		Using the relative trace formula, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the second moment. We then use the 
		method of amplification to get the subconvexity bound:
		$$L(1/2, f) \ll_\epsilon (\kappa^2)^{\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{40} + \epsilon}$$
		This is the first subconvexity result for half-integral weight modular forms in the weight aspect. 
		We also apply our second moment result to get a quantitative simultaneous non-vanishing result for 
		central values of L-functions.	</p>

	<p>Abstract: Let L(s, f) be the L-function associated with a newform f of even weight k, squarefree level N and
  trivial nebentypus. In this paper, we establish a new explicit zero-free region for L(s, f).
  More precisely, we prove that L(s, f) does not vanish in the region
  Re(s) ≥ 1 − 1 / ( C · log( kN · max(1, |Im(s)|) ) )
  with C = 16.7053 if |Im(s)| ≥ 1 or |Im(s)| ≤ 0.30992 / log(kN), and
  C = 16.9309 if 0.30992 / log(kN) &lt; |Im(s)| ≤ 1.
  This improves a result of Hoey et al. where 445.994 was shown to be an admissible value for C.

	<font size="+2"><h2>Cancellation in Sums of Hecke Eigenvalues Over Quadratic Polynomials and Mass Equidistribution</h2></font>

	<p>Abstract: We study cancellation in sums of Hecke eigenvalues over irreducible quadratic polynomials 
		over short intervals. In particular, we look at an average over bases of Hecke forms of weight k in 
		the range |k−K| &lt K<sup>θ</sup> where 1/3 &lt θ &lt 1. We see that when averaged over this family such sums admit square 
		root cancellation. The key new arithmetic input for such a result is a bound on sums of Kloosterman sums
		over irreducible quadratic polynomials. Then using work of Nelson, we relate such sums to the mass 
		equidistribution conjecture for modular forms on compact arithmetic surfaces, and we show that almost all 
		forms satisfy the mass equidistribution conjecture. Furthermore, such forms will satisfy the conjecture 
		with an effective convergence rate of k<sup>−δ</sup> for any δ &lt 1/2.

	<font size="+2"><h2>A Formula For the Number of k-almost Primes</h2></font>

	<p>Abstract: In 2005, E. Noel and G. Panos constructed a formula to count the number
		of semiprimes less than a given value x. In 2006, this formula was rediscovered
		independently by R. G. Wilson V. However, each citation of this result was simply
		through personal communication, and a formal proof has not been written down 
		anywhere in the literature. In this article, we generalize their formula to the 
		case of k-almost primes and square-free k-almost primes.

	<p>Abstract: In this paper, we prove a converse theorem for half-integral 
	weight modular forms assuming functional equations for L-series with additive 
	twists. This result is an extension of Booker, Farmer, and Lee's result in [BFL22] 
	to the half-integral weight setting. Similar to their work, the main result of this 
	paper is obtained as a consequence of the half-integral weight Petersson trace formula.</p>

	<p>Abstract:  We use Young tableaux to compute the dimension of Vr, the Prym-Brill-Noether locus 
		of a folded chain of loops of any gonality. This tropical result yields a new upper bound 
		on the dimensions of algebraic Prym-Brill-Noether loci. Moreover, we prove that Vr is pure-dimensional 
		and connected in codimension 1 when dimVr≥1. We then compute the first Betti number of this locus for 
		even gonality when the dimension is exactly 1, and compute the cardinality when the locus is finite and 
		the edge lengths are generic. </p>

	<font size="+2"><h2>Extensions of Hyperfields</h2></font>
	<p>Abstract:We develop a theory of extensions of hyperfields that generalizes the notion of field extensions. Since 
		hyperfields have a multivalued addition, we must consider two kinds of extensions that we call weak hyperfield 
		extensions and strong hyperfield extensions. For quotient hyperfields, we develop a method to construct strong 
		hyperfield extensions that contain roots to any polynomial over the hyperfield. Furthermore, we give an example 
		of a hyperfield that has two non-isomorphic minimal extensions containing a root to some polynomial. This shows
		that the process of adjoining a root to a hyperfield is not a well-defined operation.</p>
