                We decided to become a boy band: "Maximum Derek and the Boys". I was one of the boys. Yes, we have other album covers (at least 3 more).

                This was a candid photo of Henry and I towards the end of our work on our converse theorem paper. I was between this picture and one which was a Halloween costume that was an inside joke.

                This was my research group from the Inclusive Paths in Explicit Number Theory workshop in Summer 2023. This was the same trip where I went to the Kangaroo farm in Kelowna Canada.

                This is a subset of Brown's math department after we tie-dyed our shirts. Ella was sad she missed the photo, so I photoshopped her into the corner.
