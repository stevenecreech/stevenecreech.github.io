	<h1>Erdös Numbers</h1>
	<p>Paul Erdös was one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century. He was known for having many collaborators.
	This gave rise to the notion of the Erdös number which is a sense of degrees of separation from Erdös. The way it works 
	is as follows. Paul Erdös has an Erdös number of 0, if you have written a paper with Paul Erdös you have an Erdös number 
	of 1, then inductively your Erdös number will be one plus the minimum of the Erdös number of all of your coauthors.</p>

	<p>The AMS has a <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/freetools/collab-dist">tool</a> for mathematicians to calculate their Erdös Number</p>

	<p>My Erdös number is 3. </p>

	<p>I wrote a paper with Alia Hamieh who wrote a paper with Ram Murty who wrote a paper with Paul Erdös</p>

	<h1>Bacon Numbers</h1>
	<p>There is the notion of six degrees from Kevin Bacon. This leads to an analogous notion of a Bacon number. Kevin Bacon has 
	a Bacon number of 0. If you have been in a movie with Kevin Bacon, you have a Bacon number of 1. In general, your Bacon number will
	be one plus the minimum of the Bacon number of all the people you have been in a movie with.</p>

	<p>As a child, I was into theatre and had the honor of being an extra in the movie 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Ppj_ixHbg">Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas</a>
	 (you can see me dancing in the background at the timestamp of 1:32:30)</p>

	<p>Thanks to my sister who when we had watched Jurrasic World pointed out that Kelly Washington was in that movie has allowed me
	to calculate my Bacon number (or at least upper bound it) by 3 as follows.</p>

	<p>Steven Creech was in Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas with Kelly Washington</p>
	<p>Kelly Washington was in Jurrasic World with Chris Pratt</p>
	<p>Christ Pratt was in The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special with Kevin Bacon</p>

	<h1>Erdös-Bacon Numbers</h1>
	<p>An Erdös-Bacon Number is the sum of someone's Erdös number and Bacon number.
	It is meant for those who have overlapped in the math world and movie world. Thus,
	I am one of the few who has an Erdös-Bacon number which will be 6. Not too shabby. 
	This is the same Erdös-Bacon number as Stephen Hawkings, Richard Feynman, Noam Chomsky, 
	Bill Gates, Danica McKellar, and Colin Firth.  Furthermore, it seems from Wikipedia there 
	are only 4 other people in the world with a smaller Erdös-Bacon number that being Daniel Kleitman 
	(3 = 1 + 2),Nicholas Metropolis (4 = 2 + 2), Albert M. Chan (4 = 3 + 1), and Sergey Brin (5 = 3 + 2).
