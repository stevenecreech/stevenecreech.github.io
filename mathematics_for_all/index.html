title: Mathematics for ∀ll
---
	
	
	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>The goal of this page is to attempt to describe some of the mathematics that I think about in a way that most people can understand (I don't know how I will do, but I will do my best).</p>

  <p>The name of this section "Mathematics for ∀ll" is a pun. In mathematics the symbol ∀ is called the universal quantifier and when you see this symbol you say "for all".</p>
